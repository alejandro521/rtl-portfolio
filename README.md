# Alejandro's RTL Design and Verification Portfolio

Welcome to my RTL Design and Verification portfolio! I am Alejandro, a UC Berkeley EECS graduate with 2 years of academic experience in ASIC and FPGA design and verification. This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and experience in digital circuit design, verification, and FPGA prototyping. It is intended to prove my readiness for entry-level roles related to ASIC/FPGA design and verification. All the projects in this portfolio have been implemented outside of the schoolwork in the ASIC and FPGA courses I took.

## Purpose

The projects contained within this portfolio demonstrate my proficiency in:
- **SystemVerilog/Verilog** for digital circuit design
- **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)** for advanced verification strategies
- **FPGA Prototyping** using the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (via the Arty-A7 development board)
- **Python scripting** for automation of the design and verification process
- **Post-synthesis Report Analysis** using Xilinx Vivado for synthesis

Additionally, the projects highlight my deep knowledge of:
- **System-on-Chip (SoC) design**
- **CPU architecture**
- **Memory controllers and cache design**
- **Interconnect and communication protocols**
- **Peripheral interface design**

## Skill Set

This portfolio reflects the following technical competencies:

- **Hardware Description Languages**: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- **Verification Methodologies**: UVM, traditional Verilog testbenches
- **FPGA Tools**: Xilinx Vivado
- **Scripting and Automation**: Python
- **Circuit Design & Debugging**: Digital circuit design, debugging, optimization
- **Design & Performance Metrics**: Timing, resource utilization, and power analysis
- **SoC Components**: CPUs, caches, memory controllers, interconnects
- **Linux**: Workflow and toolchain management on Linux OS

Additional:
- **ASIC Tools**: Although not used in the projects here, I have used tools such as Synopsys VCS and Cadence Genus and Innovus back when I was in school

## Projects Overview

This portfolio is organized into multiple projects, each targeting a specific set of skills and concepts relevant to ASIC/FPGA design or verification roles.

## Goals

The primary objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my:
1. **Mastery of RTL design and verification principles** using industry-standard methodologies and tools.
2. **Ability to analyze, debug, and optimize digital circuits**, from the RTL level through synthesis and post-synthesis stages.
3. **Commitment to continuous learning and technical growth**, as evidenced by self-directed study and project implementation beyond academic coursework.
